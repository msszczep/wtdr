# wtdr

A surprisingly complicated Python program to test for two words that
don't rhyme.  Inspired by a game I play with my three-year-old son.

From the command line:

`python ./words_that_dont_rhyme.py`

You'll then receive a pair of English words that don't rhyme.

Requires the cmudict file from the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
residing in the present working directory.
